# Caching Strategy Capability - Delta Spec

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Tier Cache Architecture

The system SHALL implement a multi-tier caching architecture with in-memory (hot cache), SQLite (warm cache), and optional Redis (distributed cache) layers to optimize for both performance and persistence.

#### Scenario: Hot cache lookup (in-memory)

- **WHEN** a frequently accessed API response is requested
- **THEN** the system checks the in-memory LRU cache first (< 1ms latency)
- **AND** returns immediately if present and not expired
- **AND** falls back to SQLite cache on memory miss

#### Scenario: Warm cache lookup (SQLite)

- **WHEN** in-memory cache misses but data exists in SQLite
- **THEN** the system retrieves from SQLite (< 10ms latency)
- **AND** populates the in-memory cache for subsequent requests
- **AND** logs cache promotion event

#### Scenario: Cold cache scenario (API fetch)
